# TITAN++ Ultra - Autonomous AI Development System

## Overview

TITAN++ Ultra is an autonomous AI development platform that uses DeepSeek Coder as its sole LLM backend to perform sophisticated code generation, refactoring, debugging, and cross-language fusion operations. The system implements a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to handle different aspects of software development, from architectural design to documentation generation.

The platform operates entirely locally (except for the DeepSeek API calls) and provides a complete development environment with sandboxed code execution, version control through checkpoints, and a web-based UI for interaction.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The core of TITAN++ is a **multi-agent system** where seven specialized AI agents work collaboratively:

- **Architect Prime**: Makes high-level architectural decisions, designs system structures, and plans refactoring strategies
- **Master Engineer**: Implements code across all languages and frameworks, focusing on production-quality implementations
- **Refactor Overlord**: Performs code optimization, modernization, and quality improvements while preserving functionality
- **Debugger Sentinel**: Analyzes errors, generates tests, and auto-repairs broken code
- **Fusion Warden**: Handles cross-language code conversion and project fusion across Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C++, and PHP
- **CheckPoint Arbiter**: Manages version control, creates snapshots, and enables time-travel debugging
- **Documentation Sage**: Generates comprehensive documentation, READMEs, and API guides

All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` and communicate through the `TitanOrchestrator`, which routes tasks and coordinates their activities.

### Cognitive Pipeline (Five-Layer Processing)

The system implements a **five-layer cognitive pipeline** for understanding and transforming code:

1. **Perception Layer**: Scans project structures, identifies languages/frameworks, and builds semantic maps of codebases
2. **Interpretation Layer**: Analyzes code behavior and detects patterns (design pattern - not yet fully implemented)
3. **Intent Engine**: Plans multi-step code transformations (design pattern - not yet fully implemented)
4. **Execution Layer**: Applies code changes and generates implementations
5. **Evolution Layer**: Continuously improves architecture and optimizes systems (design pattern - not yet fully implemented)

The Perception Layer is currently the most developed, providing project scanning and structure analysis.

### API & Communication Layer

**Backend (Express + WebSocket)**:
- REST API endpoints for synchronous operations (`/api/analyze`, `/api/generate`, `/api/refactor`, `/api/debug`)
- WebSocket server for real-time streaming responses and progress updates
- All requests route through the `TitanOrchestrator` which delegates to appropriate agents

**Frontend (React + Vite)**:
- Single-page application built with React 18 and TypeScript
- Communicates with backend via Axios (REST) and WebSocket
- Provides UI for code generation, analysis, and agent status monitoring

### Checkpoint & Version Control System

Custom checkpoint system for project state management:
- **Timestamped snapshots** with complete file diffs
- **Semantic summaries** of changes (generated by AI)
- **Instant rollback** to any previous state
- **Version hash tracking** for integrity verification
- Stored as JSON files in the `checkpoints/` directory

Design rationale: Standard version control systems (Git) are heavyweight and complex for AI-driven operations. This custom system provides lightweight, AI-optimized state management specifically designed for autonomous code manipulation.

### Sandbox Execution Environment

**Docker-based isolated execution**:
- Containerized code execution for Python, Node.js, Go, and Rust
- Optional network isolation for security
- 30-second default timeout per execution
- Temporary workspace directories for each execution
- Uses official Docker images (e.g., `node:20-alpine`)

Design choice: Docker provides consistent, isolated environments and prevents malicious code from affecting the host system. This is critical for an autonomous system that generates and executes arbitrary code.

### Cross-Language Fusion Engine

Supports five fusion modes:
1. **Direct Merge**: Combine projects without language conversion
2. **Full Conversion**: Convert entire repository to target language
3. **Bidirectional**: Maintain hybrid multi-language architecture
4. **Neural Semantic**: AI-driven semantic-level fusion
5. **Adaptive**: TITAN++ automatically selects best approach

The Fusion Warden agent handles all conversion logic, leveraging DeepSeek's multi-language understanding to maintain functionality across language boundaries.

## External Dependencies

### Primary AI Backend
- **DeepSeek Coder**: Sole LLM provider for all AI operations
  - Configured via `DEEPSEEK_ENDPOINT` environment variable
  - Default: `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`
  - Optional API key via `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
  - Model selection via `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` (default: `deepseek-coder`)
  - All agent reasoning, code generation, and analysis flows through this single endpoint

### Infrastructure & Runtime
- **Docker**: Required for sandbox code execution
  - Used for isolated, containerized execution of generated code
  - Supports multiple language runtimes (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust)
  - Network isolation capabilities for security
  
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the TITAN++ system itself
  - Express server for API layer
  - WebSocket server for real-time communication

### Code Parsing & Analysis
- **Babel**: JavaScript/TypeScript AST parsing and traversal (`@babel/parser`, `@babel/traverse`, `@babel/types`)
- **Acorn**: Alternative JavaScript parser with tree walking (`acorn`, `acorn-walk`)
- **TypeScript Compiler API**: Advanced TypeScript manipulation (`ts-morph`)
- **Esprima**: ECMAScript parsing
- **JSCodeshift**: Codemods and transformations

These tools support the Perception Layer's code analysis and the Refactor Overlord's transformation capabilities.

### File System & Utilities
- **glob**: Pattern-based file discovery
- **ignore**: `.gitignore`-style file filtering
- **diff**: Generating diffs for checkpoint system
- **uuid**: Unique identifier generation for checkpoints and tasks

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **Axios**: HTTP client for REST API communication

### No Database Required
The system uses file-based storage for checkpoints (JSON files) and does not require a traditional database. This keeps the system lightweight and portable while maintaining all necessary state in version-controlled files.
